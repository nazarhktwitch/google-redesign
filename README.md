# Google Redesign

This is a personal project where I redesigned Google's homepage with a modern and clean look.  
The goal was to practice UI/UX design and CSS styling.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-redesign.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd google-redesign
   ```
3. Run a project:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Or, alternatively, you can run a python http server:
   ```bash

You can also find a production build in the [dist](dist) folder.
